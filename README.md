# Automated-Disease-Diagnosis-System
INTRODUCTION:
        
  The development of an Automated Disease Diagnosis System (ADDS) utilizing cutting-edge machine 
learning techniques. The ADDS is designed to revolutionize disease diagnosis by 
automating the process and harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms 
to analyse patient data comprehensively. By integrating diverse sources of patient 
information, including medical history, symptoms, laboratory test results, and 
imaging studies, the ADDS aims to provide accurate and timely diagnoses.

OVERVIEW OF ADDS:
         
  The Automated Disease Diagnosis System is designed to streamline the 
diagnostic process by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyse patient 
data efficiently and accurately. The system comprises several key components, 
each contributing to its overall functionality and performance.
At its core, the system integrates various modules for data collection, 
preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, evaluation, and 
deployment. These modules work synergistically to process input data, train 
machine learning models, and generate automated disease diagnoses in real-time.

  The data is cleaned by removing the Null values and converting the labels to numerical format, Itâ€™s time to split 
the data to train and test the model. We will be splitting the data into 80:20 format i.e. 80% of the dataset will be 
used for training the model and 20% of the data will be used to evaluate the performance of the models.

MODEL SELECTION AND DEVELOPMENT:

Support Vector Machines (SVM):
         
  Support Vector Machines (SVM) are powerful supervised learning 
algorithms that excel in both classification and regression tasks. SVM operates 
by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points into different classes, 
maximizing the margin between classes.

Naive Bayes:
 
  Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' 
theorem, with strong assumptions of feature independence. Despite its simplicity, 
Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in practice and is particularly useful 
for text classification and medical diagnosis tasks.

Random Forest:

  Random Forest is a versatile ensemble learning algorithm that combines 
the predictive power of multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. It 
offers robustness to overfitting and noise, making it well-suited for disease 
diagnosis tasks.

EVALUATION:

  In the realm of automated disease diagnosis, robust evaluation and 
validation processes are indispensable to ascertain the efficacy and reliability of 
machine learning models. This section delves into the comprehensive evaluation 
framework, detailing performance metrics, experimentation procedures, and 
preliminary results analysis.

CONCLUSION:

  The implications for clinical 
practice resulting from the development and deployment of the Automated 
Disease Diagnosis System.

RESULT: 
           
  The development of the Automated Disease Diagnosis 
System has been a significant step towards providing users with a convenient and 
reliable tool for preliminary disease identification based on symptoms. 
Leveraging machine learning algorithms and web technologies, we have 
successfully created a system capable of data-driven predicting diseases using 
input symptoms.
In this section, we analyse the sample output obtained from the Automated 
Disease Diagnosis System. The output provides valuable insights into the 
performance and functionality of the system.
